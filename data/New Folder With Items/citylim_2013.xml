			<abstract>This data represents the State of Oregon city limit boundaries. Each city limit is defined as a continuous area within the statutory boundary of an incorporated city, which is the smallest subdivision of an annexed area. It is represented as spatial data (polygon with label point).</abstract>
			<purpose>The use of city limits information was identified as a need for general planning purposes within ODOT. It was determined that this would be a frequently used data set that needed to be both spatially referenced and attributed in a GIS base layer. The decision was made to create a statewide coverage of the boundary outlining the city limits for each of the 242 incorporated cities. An incorporated city may have multiple areas that are not contiguous. Each such area is represented separately with its own polygon. The area of the city limits will be calculated from the polygons created.</purpose>
			<supplinf>An area may be annexed into a city from an unincorporated area or from another incorporated city. Each annexation may have multiple parts, which are not necessarily contiguous. When an area is annexed from another city, this may create one or more fragments, which are subdivisions of one or more existing parts.</supplinf>

		<useconst>For assessment and taxation purposes, the boundary change process has two key dates. One is the effective date of the boundary change. The other is the filing deadline with the Department of Revenue. While both of these dates relate to boundary changes, they operate independently. The two key dates are March 31 and July 1. These dates help determine the property affected by a boundary change. The district must file its boundary change documents in final approved form to the Department of Revenue Cadastral Information Systems Unit by March 31 and obtain a notice of approval. In order for a district to extend its tax rate to an annexed territory, the district&apos;s annexation must be effective on or before July 1. ORS 308.225 instructs the assessor to disregard any changes or proposed changes to the boundary lines of taxing districts for assessment and taxation purposes in the ensuing fiscal year if the change is not filed in final approved form by March 31. The March 31 date and the approval by the Department of Revenue only relates to the boundary change for assessment and taxation purposes. It does not effect or relate to filings for any other purpose. ORS 308.225 also details the level of description for the boundary change.</useconst>

			<attraccr>Attributes that have derived values have not been tested to determine the accuracy.  Attributes with software assigned values are assumed to be accurate.  Attributes with keyed in values are filtered by database design to accept only certain formats of information.  This does not preclude errors, it does, however, minimize them.  Additional, in-house, review is conducted to identify errors.</attraccr>
			<qattracc>
				<attraccv>Digitizing Accuracy</attraccv>
				<attracce>One of the main considerations we have when placing new line-work is the probable inclusion of the line-work into a GIS base layer.  For this reason we need to take extra measures to assure that newly placed lines are snapped to end-points, and that every intersection is broken and no overlaps or open intersections exist. Duplicate line-work is also a problem.

What do we do to resolve anomalous line-work?  Perhaps we find an overlap or a gap exists between existing line-work and the new parcel, or maybe a given legal description shows that one leg of a parcel adjoins a highway right-of-way for which a readily available description does not exist.  One method for resolving this is to obtain a copy of the county property assessment map from the Oregon Department of Revenue (DOR).  If existing records don&apos;t resolve the anomaly, an estimated resolution is employed.  This method is not ideal, but experience and an informed idea of what the city intends, helps to minimize error (Educated guesswork).

If an obvious overlap occurs with a new annexation and the existing city limits,  we assume (guess) that the overlapped area is intended to be included in the revised boundary.  It doesn&apos;t matter that it overlaps, the intent of the city is to include it.  If a sliver or gap between parcels becomes apparent to us, we call the city planning dept. and ask for a clarification.  Many of these anomalies occur by mistake, and aren&apos;t supposed to exist.  We ask for what the city intends.  We have found that these types of problems occur more often in communities that have limited resources.  The number of occurances varies from year to year, but a figure of 5% is probably close to the average.

For clarity, unless the boundary follows the centerline of a street or highway, an offset is employed to an estimated right of way.  This offset averages 10 feet, and merely indicates that the line follows a right of way.  Rights of way are seldom an even number of feet.   Exceptions to the 10 foot offset placement will occur when the placed line is between two converging or parallel highways or roads, and it seems reasonable to split the difference which may be less than or more than 10 feet.  Another exception may occur when the line parallels a feature that has many vertices and it&apos;s reasonable to use fewer to place the boundary.

As annexations are entered, we print out scale plots of newly annexed areas and transfer that information onto our counter maps.  Printed records of the annexations are placed in Current City Map Corrections file drawers.</attracce>

				<attraccv>Software Derived Data Accuracy</attraccv>
				<attracce>Several attribute values are derived from software needs.  These attributes are defined in the Entity and Attribute section and are identified by &quot;Maintained by GeoMedia Pro v6.0 software&quot; or &quot;Calculated by GeoMedia Pro v6.0 software&quot; descriptions.  These attributes may be dependent on digitizing accuracy, precision input or the source data accuracy.  There has been no attempt to verify items like measured areas within polygons to determine attribute accuracy.</attracce>
			</qattracc>
			<qattracc>
				<attraccv>Source Data Accuracy</attraccv>
				<attracce>Beginning in 1990, Oregon surveyors initiated the Partition Plat Law to allow for simplified legal descriptions. New land partitions of three or fewer parcels are now described by partition plat and parcel numbers, similar to the lot and block descriptions of subdivisions. This process makes parcel descriptions increasingly difficult to track and plot unless the original plat is available to verify the dimensions of that parcel, or copies of the county map showing bearings and distances can be used for verification.

The DOR is responsible for reviewing and approving annexations for assessment purposes as per O.R.S. 308.225. Occasionally annexations do not contain a correct description or accompanying maps. DOR works with the annexing body to resolve the issues. Annexations are also recorded in the Secretary of State&apos;s Office as per O.R.S.198.780.  The Secretary of State&apos;s Office catalogs but does not review the annexations for accuracy. Prior to a cooperative effort between the ODOT and the Oregon Department of Revenue, the information in the Secretary of State&apos;s Office was used by ODOT to determine new city limits.

Unfortunately, not all cities have consistently complied with O.R.S.198.70. Traditionally, the only annexations available to ODOT are those that have been received by the Sec. Of State&apos;s office.  Currently, information from the DOR can be cross-referenced with information from the Secretary of State&apos;s Office to solve discrepancies.

Our maps are a graphic representation of the sum of information available to us. Our maps are not an exact replica of the real world due to the amount of information collected, the number of places it was collected from, and due to the fact that no map (digital or hand drawn) paints a perfect picture.  As a matter of record, maps are not legal documents.  Text (survey) descriptions of a property is the legal definition of a property.</attracce>

		<logic>All polygons close, with no overlaps or gaps and form clean bounding polygons for the city limits and city annexations.  All linework is feature tagged and all centroids are feature tagged and attributed.  Every centroid is bounded by the feature tagged linestring.  If a bounding linestring does not contain a centroid then the linestring belongs to a larger bounding linestring of an original city limits attributed centroid.</logic>
